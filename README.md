## Hardware Implementation and Advanced Testing
For several lab tasks, I implemented the designs on hardware, specifically using the **FPGA XEN 10 board**. This provided a practical testbed for validating my designs beyond simulation, ensuring that they work under real-world conditions.

In addition, I applied **ScanChain** techniques for hardware testing, enabling fault detection and simplifying debugging processes. I also utilized **JTAG** for further testing and debugging of hardware implementations, enhancing the overall reliability of the designs.
